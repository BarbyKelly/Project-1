# Energy Work

This project's goal is to share different types of methods used for Energy Work, to show people how these methods can make a difference to our wellbeing. This page is suitable for people who are interested in using their own hands, colour, imagination, to work with their energy and maybe clear some energy blocks. Many of this page's author's friends and family have asked her for tips in regards to energy work, which tools to use. It's lovely to be able to gather some of her research on this page, and share the links instead of individual messages. And this way people can choose which method seems the best for them, instead of author sharing her "latest find". She has had interest and passion for natural healing, energy work from very young age. For the creator of this page, natural methods seemed always normal part of her life.

## Features

Home page shares energy tools how to shift your own energy. Sharing my own experiences of trying many different methods
to improve my own and my family's wellbeing. On this page visitor can click on links to access Youtube videos, read an example of an ebook, click on a link to learn about Tapping EFT. 
This page includes an image taken by me, Ballyheigue County Kerry. I feel good and peaceful looking at this image, and I hope visitors of this site have a pleasant feeling looking at the image, and that they can find links useful.

The goal here is to share the possible benefits from working with your own energy. It is understandable that each person has their own unique experience, and examples given under Benefits section are some of the changes that the author of this page has noticed.

Sign up page is created for the project to show that form works. At the moment sign ups won't be saved anywhere, as it's just a mock page.
Originally I wanted it to be a form where people vote which part of the page they liked the most. My mentor recommended to use a form where
people share their own experience

- Code

- - Copied from Love Running
/* Asterisk wildcard selector to override default styles added by the browser. */
* {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

- - Copied from Love Running:

/* Nav toggle */
#nav-toggle:checked~nav {
    display: block;
}

#nav-toggle {
    display: none;
}

.nav-toggle-label {
    font-size: 2rem;
}

- - Typed exactly like in Love Running, as my nav bar stopped working after rearranging my pages, I wanted to ensure project is ok for testing, screenshots. Unfortunately still not ok for testing.

 #menu {
        display: flex;
    }

    #menu > li {
        padding-left: 1rem;
    }

    .nav-toggle-label {
        display: none;
    }

## Issues Fixed

- Embed code - video size
iframe video images embed code: too big. I changed height and width of these, reduced them all to one size. 

- Signup form labels needed to be displayed:none, as placeholders were enough. Changing display to none for the signup label, caused menu dots not display as well on the header. Working tree helped to see what change could have caused menu to not display. Adding .signup to the label, and setting display: none, helped to not have labels display for signup form, and keep the menu dots
