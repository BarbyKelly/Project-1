# Energy Work

This project's goal is to raise awareness about Energy Work, to show people how simple tools can make a difference to our wellbeing, our every day life. This page is suitable for people of all ages, who are interested in using their own hands, colour, imagination, to work with their energy and clear some energy blocks. Many of my friends and family have asked me for tips in regards to energy work, which tools to use. It's lovely to be able to gather some of my research on this page, and share the links instead of individual messages. And this way people can choose which method seems the best for them, instead of me sharing my "latest find". I have had interest and passion for natural healing, energy work from very young age. For me natural methods seemed always normal part of the life.

## Features

Home page shares energy tools how to shift your own energy. Sharing my own experiences of trying many different methods
to improve my own and my family's wellbeing. On this page visitor can click on links to access Youtube videos, read an example of an ebook, click on a link to learn about Tapping EFT. 
This page includes an image taken by me, Ballyheigue County Kerry. I feel good and peaceful looking at this image, and I hope visitors of this site have a pleasant feeling looking at the image, and that they can find links useful.

Benefits page mentions some of the benefits that I have received from engaging with energy work. As far as I understand there can be many more positive side-effects from working with energy, using natural energy changing methods. It is probably different for each person. 

Sign up page is created for the project to show that form works. At the moment sign ups won't be saved anywhere, as it's just a mock page.
Originally I wanted it to be a form where people vote which part of the page they liked the most. My mentor recommended to use a form where
people share their own experience
