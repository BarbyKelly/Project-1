# Energy Work

This project's goal is to share different types of methods used for Energy Work, to show people how these methods can make a difference to our wellbeing. This page is suitable for people who are interested in using their own hands, colour, imagination, to work with their energy and maybe clear some energy blocks. Many of this page's author's friends and family have asked her for tips in regards to energy work, which tools to use. It's lovely to be able to gather some of her research on this page, and share the links instead of individual messages. And this way people can choose which method seems the best for them, instead of author sharing her "latest find". She has had interest and passion for natural healing, energy work from very young age. For the creator of this page, natural methods seemed always normal part of her life.

## Features

Home page shares energy tools how to start to work or sense your own energy. On this page visitor can click on links to access Youtube videos, find a link that brings visitor to another page to read an example of an ebook (how to understand your body and some symptoms), or click on a link to learn about Tapping EFT. 
This page includes an image taken by me, Ballyheigue County Kerry. I feel good and peaceful looking at this image, and I hope visitors of this site have a pleasant feeling looking at the image, and that they can find links useful.

Benefits page: the goal here is to share the possible benefits from working with your own energy. It is understandable that each person has their own unique experiences, and examples given under Benefits section are some of the changes that the author of this page has noticed.

Sign up page is created for the project to show that form works. At the moment sign ups won't be saved anywhere, as it's just for the purpose of this project

-_Tools for Wellbeing Table_

- Content of this table is aimed to make it easy for the user to find the area they are interested in, and to click on the video link, or link to read part of the book mentioned on the table. Autoplay and full-screen option have been removed from the embed code, to support visitors who prefer to play videos at their own time, at their own terms. Embed code helps to see what these videos are about. 

- Table also includes samples of page creator's personal experiences while using all of these different energy tools

-_Social Media Links_

-Links for social media have been added in the footer for all of the pages. All links are clickable, and visitor is taken to the main page of each website. As this project is a sample project by a software development student, these links are not linked to any social media connected to Energy Work.

-All social media links open in a new page, which leaves Energy Work page open, and visitor has an option to return to this page if they so wish to do

-_Sign Up_

- This form has been created for the project, to show functioning form. The author added Title option, with a drop down menu, and fields for First Name, Last Name and an email address. Form comes with Sign Up button, to complete signing up for emails. If it was a form for an actual business, or sole trader, blogger, email sign up would mean receiveng updates about the latest energy work research that the author has found, or read about. 

- Sign up for emails has a favicon of a sun beside it, to brighten up the visitor's day.

#### Features Left to Implement

- As project's due date is today, 22.12.2023, and the site is still not completely ok on mobile view, there is still a lot to do. Media settings, to adjust Image label on Benefits page, tidy up table on the landing page. Due to unforseen circumstances I was not able to work on the project for some of the days. I understand that I'll have an opportunity in 2024 to adjust this project, once Code Institute says it's ok to edit again.

## Issues Fixed

- Embed code - video size
iframe video images embed code looked too big for this website. I changed height and width of these, reduced them all to one size. 

- Signup form labels needed to be displayed:none, as placeholders were enough. Changing display to none for the signup label, caused menu dots not display as well on the header. Working tree helped to see what change could have caused menu to not display. Adding .signup to the label, and setting display: none, helped to not have labels display for signup form, and keep the menu dots
