                short videos to improve how I felt. It was lovely to feel warmth in the area that had been sore before. Lovely.

        <td>I have found Inna's book very useful. Her tips how to use colour to reduce fever, or sudden skin reaction. Her wisdom has guided me to 
        understand better what emotions and situations have caused certain health issues, symptoms. It has been lovely to clear earache, skin reactions and so on with
        natural methods, understanding body's messages. I am sharing link to her ebook, as I find it so handy to have it available on the phone when needed, and ebook 
        makes it easier to search all the terms re skin or any other symptoms, body parts. Forever grateful. <a href="https://amzn.eu/gFB6Mo7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

        <tr>
            <td>Myself and my kids have benefitted from EFT Tapping on many occassions. Sometimes I mix EFT with Inna Segal's guidance, eg using light blue colour
                to cool down sudden skin reaction, and then using EFT Tapping to find out what happened. EFT Tapping has helped us to clear fear of water, anxiety,
                and aches/pains.
